Analysis of the NYC Parking Ticket Data from Aug 2013 - Jun 2017 using Python &amp; Data Science

Data Source = https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets

Original Source with complete and up to date FY2020 =

Context = Produced by the New York City Department of Finance, this dataset contains parking violations issued by fiscal year.

Size = 9 million recoreds per year with 43 columns.

Purpose/Goal = Initially, use python and data science to extract insights from the dataset.  
Longterm, build an infrastructure, workflow or API that consumes this data and pushes it to visuialzations.  

Initial Questions: 
1. Where are you most likley to get a ticket?
2. When are you most likley to get a ticket?
3. What color gets the most tickets every year?
4. What Make (manufacturer) gets the most tickets per year in NYC?
5. What neighborhood has the most tickets?

Plan for this porject:
1. Simple import and exlorartory analysis using the Bokeh Package https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html and Pandas and NumPy.  Clean and combine all of the data into a single file to load into the program.
2. Plots (line charts, bar charts and etc), tables and simple statistices for summerization of the dataset.
2b. Map of NYC showing where the tickets are geographically
3. Inferential analysis using Pandas and NumPy
4. Statistical/Predictive analysis using Python, NumPy, R and additional tools with Python
5. Answer initial questions
6. Build comparative visualizations in Tableau, and R
