# Python NYC Parking Tickets FY2020-FY2023
Analysis of the NYC Parking Ticket Data from FY2020-FY2023 using Python and some Data Science

Data Source = https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

Original Source with complete and up to date FY2020 = 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2020/p7t3-5i9s/about_data
Note: Years after 2023 will be added and updated later.

Context = Produced by the New York City Department of Finance, this dataset contains parking violations issued by fiscal year.

Size = 9 million recoreds per year with 43 columns.

Purpose/Goal = Initially, use python and data science to extract insights from the dataset.  
Longterm, build an infrastructure, workflow or API that consumes this data and pushes it to visuialzations.  

Initial Questions: 
1. Where are you most likley to get a ticket?
2. When are you most likley to get a ticket?
3. What color gets the most tickets every year?
4. What Make (manufacturer) gets the most tickets per year in NYC?
5. What neighborhood has the most tickets?

Plan for this porject:
1. Simple import and exlorartory analysis using the Bokeh Package https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html and Pandas and NumPy.  
1a. Load All Data into some type of database system or platform and perform statistical analysis there
1b. Determine how to query and fetch the data once its all been stored and compiled
2. Plots (line charts, bar charts and etc), tables and simple statistices for summerization of the dataset.
3. Map of NYC showing where the tickets are geographically
4. Inferential analysis using Pandas and NumPy
5. Statistical/Predictive analysis using Python, NumPy, R and additional tools with Python
6. Answer initial questions
7. Build comparative visualizations in Tableau, and R
